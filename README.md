# ☕ BREWHAUS — 3D Scroll-Driven Coffee Experience

An immersive, premium 3D web experience built with **Next.js 14**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**, powered by a high-performance **HTML5 Canvas** particle engine. 

The website delivers a sensory digital journey through interactive scroll-triggered animations, fluid-dynamic steam simulations, kinetic coffee bean physics, and a luxurious, fully responsive layout.

## ✨ Features & Interactive Elements

*   **🎬 Interactive 3D Canvas Scroll System**
    *   **Smooth Scene Cross-Fade**: Fades between a clean product studio scene and a cozy, warm café atmosphere dynamically as the user scrolls.
    *   **Parallax Zoom & Shift**: The canvas responds dynamically to scroll coordinates with custom easing.
    *   **3D Mouse-Parallax**: Subtly shifts perspective based on real-time mouse coordinate tracking, offering a sense of spatial depth.
*   **💨 Procedural Particle Simulation**
    *   **Kinetic Steam Emitters**: Dual emitters simulate organic rising steam using customizable velocity, life span, and size growth factor.
    *   **Scroll-Driven Wind/Velocity**: High-speed scrolling increases the upward kinetic force, causing the steam to rise faster.
    *   **Floating Coffee Beans & Ambient Steam**: Custom rendering curves draw floating 3D-esque beans and natural coffee steam that respond to scrolls.
*   **🛒 Artisanal Product Showcase**
    *   **The Reserve Line**: Beautiful grid layout featuring premium single-origin coffees (e.g., *Ethiopian Yirgacheffe*, *Sumatra Mandheling*) with custom card entrance animations.
    *   **Interactive Cart**: Responsive state updates with micro-animations when adding products to the selection count.
*   **🎨 Premium Coffee Aesthetic**
    *   Deep espresso gradients (`#1A0F0A` to `#0A0503`), luxury gold accents, glassmorphic navigations, and typography (Playfair Display & Inter).

## 🔧 How to Customize

### Adding/Modifying Blends
You can update the coffee selections, origins, prices, and roast notes in [products.ts](file:///d:/My%20Projects/COFFEE-3D-WEBSITE/data/products.ts).

### Tweaking Particle Physics
In [HeroCanvasAnimation.tsx](file:///d:/My%20Projects/COFFEE-3D-WEBSITE/components/HeroCanvasAnimation.tsx):
*   Change particle limits by adjusting `maxParticles` and `maxSteamParticles`.
*   Adjust scroll damping and spring stiffness by tweaking the config inside `useSpring(scrollYProgress, { stiffness, damping })`.
*   Modify steam drift speeds by updating the `vy` velocity calculations in `createSteamParticle`.
